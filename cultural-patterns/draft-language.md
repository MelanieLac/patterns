## Culture Patterns

### Language as clue

Paradigms = cultural systems, contains beliefs/assumptions

language = lens framing our perception of reality.

Can we map paradigms make visible the invisible ?

A paradigm is a tightly knit cosmology that frames the way we see everything we look at, hear or otherwise experience.

It is held together by our beliefs about the working of "reality", which are held as dominant agreements that binds communities of places or interest.

Paradigms then become pattern generators in thinking, perception, and language, and therefore of action.

Language is one of the lenses that shape our experience.Language evokes or presents metaphors depending on the culture, and it forms in ways that are paradigm-based and more or less directly correlated.


### Social Objects

People gather by affinity in communities of action or practice around social objects, i.e. the ‘objects’ upon which they choose to focus their caring attention and efforts, the ‘causes’ they espouse, which may be of different natures (for example related to people, places, issues, knowledge, resources, processes, or desired outcomes 2 ). These social objects act as attractors and centers of shared visions, values, goals, and action. They are the nodes around which common experiences, languages, cultures, praxis, and the resulting knowledge and know-how are shaped. They provide the context and the content for the processes by which individual and collective identities are constructed, transformed, and differentiated in relation to each other and to the forces that hold people together, that which Husserl and Habermas called lifeworlds (Gregory, 1996). These clusters of cooperating agents and specialized agency constitute the living cognitive systems, which together form ‘society’ (Veitas & Weinbaum, 2015).

The thing to remember is, Human beings do not socialize in a completely random way. There’s a tangible reason for us being together, that ties us together. Again, that reason is called the Social Object. Social Networks form around Social Objects, not the other way around.
Another thing to remember is the world of Social Objects can have many layers. As with any complex creature, there can be more than one reason for us to be together.

### Powerful story
**Tell a powerful story**

In the field of co-intelligence, stories are more than dramas people tell or read. Story, as a pattern, is a powerful way of organizing and sharing individual experience and exploring and co-creating shared realites. It forms one of the underlying structures of reality, comprehensible and responsive to those who possess what we call narrative intelligence. Our psyches and cultures are filled with narrative fields of influence, or story fields, which shape the awareness and behavior of the individuals and collectives associated with them.

#### Story structure

**Situation, complication, and resolution story structure	**	

One of the reasons presentations are dull is because there are no identifiable story patterns.		Whether for writing a movie or a business presentation, the most simplistic way to describe the structure of a story is situation, complication, and resolution. From mythic adventures to recollections shared around the dinner table, all stories follow this pattern. (RELATABLE AND LIKABLE HERO, ENCOUNTERS ROADBLOCKS, EMERGES TRANSFORMED)  Great stories introduce you to a hero to whom you can relate. The hero is usually a likeable sort who has an acute desire or goal that is threatened in some way. As the story unfolds and trials are met with triumph, you cheer for the hero until the story is resolved and the hero is transformed. As author Robert McKee explains, ‚ÄúSomething must be at stake that convinces the audience that a great deal will be lost if the hero doesn't obtain his goal.‚Äù If nothing is at risk, then it's not interesting.

### Archetypes

Archetypes, etymologically the ‘original’ pattern, model or type, are defined by
psychiatrist Carl Jung (1964) as the unconscious representation of a universal prototype
of a concept which may be used to interpret observations, externally manifested in
symbols or tales and mythologies which can be found across cultures and time. (Finidori 2016)

### Boundary objects

Boundary objects, a term first coined by sociologist Susan Leigh Star are “objects which are both plastic enough to adapt to local needs and constraints of the several parties employing them, yet robust enough to maintain a common identity across sites. They are weakly structured in common use, and become strongly structured in individual-site use. They may be abstract or concrete. They have different meanings in different social worlds but their structure is common enough to more than one world to make them recognizable, a means of translation. The creation and management of boundary objects is key in developing and maintaining coherence across intersecting social worlds.” (Star & Griesemer, 1989, p393)
Boundary objects have a key role in meaning-making and in mediating communication
across groups. They act as attractors around which opinions can be clustered and mapped,
boundaries probed, controversies identified, and points of vue and interpretations
confronted and meta-stabilized. What lies ‘in between’ can be explored as boundary
objects as well, enabling navigation across complexity factors and dimensions.

### Hacking

This is the essence of a hacker’s approach such as described by Scott (2014, 2015) in relation to the finance system: "The large part of the complexity and opacity we are faced with is that it neutralizes political action.
There is ... a large diffuse body of people who can’t really articulate what they don’t like about the [financial] system and how to change it... I used the hacker ethics analogy and framework... It involves exploring something to see it not as a thing, but as a set of interacting components. Hacking is figuring out the internal impulse of things to figure them out. But the important question with the hacker approach is what are you aiming to achieve with this impulse.”

### Misspelled words
In certain cases freedom of expression or excessive politeness, certain words can be blocked or monitored electronically.

A simple language hack to avoid this is to use slightly mispelled words to avoid censorship and/or detection.
For example the combination will speak to a human, but will be hard to detect for an algorithm.
