# David Ing's applied patterning

David Ing is the one of the person with the freshest brain/view on patterns. His arguments are interesting and keypoints listed here


He compares Alexander's generative construction method (as described in "the battle for the life and beauty of the earth") and agile m√©thods. The way of describing " from A to B" is a good way to show difference between traditional/cartesian/linear approaches and systemic approaches

# Comparison between Alexander and Agile methods

## From System-B to System-A

### (i) Pattern language for the community

From preprogrammed assembly to local adaptation with feedback and correction

### (ii) Construction budget
From overemphasizing tangible aspects to negotiating collective feelings

### (iii) Reality of the land
From drawing abstract layout plans to adjusting the wholeness on the real site


## From waterfall methods to agile

### (i) Writing user stories
From detailing specifications to  conversing on narratives

### (ii) Scoping; estimating value,  costs and dates
From projecting and committing to converging on estimates

### (iii) Reviewing iteratively; tracking work item backlogs
From dividing-and-conquering to collaborating for learning
