# Pattern Name

It seems Alexander used only nouns to name pattern in his language. I was wondering if there's a reason for that or if patterns could be named using verbs as some other authors have done to name their good practices in the pattern format.

One reason for using only nouns is patterns are description of configurations, but they themselves are arranged relatively to each other.

ROOF is above the WALLS, WINDOWS are within the WALLS
