First target should be Android: Canalys notes tht 51% of app downloads are Android downloads while only 40% are iPhone downloads. Kantar puts Android phone sales growth at 51.2% and iOS at 43.5%. In the embedded base there are about 900 million Android devices out there and only 600 million iOS devices (ALL - including iPhone, iPad, etc. — data from Flurry.) The app should be done in conjunction with a publisher, who will share in the revenue stream, to avoid copyright tranfer complications and to enlist the support of a publisher in coordinated release and marketing. | 4Q2018                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                   |

| Question: Do we want to include the Harrison / Coplien patterns in the book or just reference them?                       | The book should stand alone but it could get pretty large if we include all the patterns we cite. Maybe just set up a spot on the web? Include half-page patlets for each, together with the quintessential photo?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 26/10/2017                                                                                                                                                                                     | Having new patlets helps.
